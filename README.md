# name-list
Random name list generator for pissing people off.

This morning, my friend Jessica showed me a list of all the people who are important to her in her life.
Ironically, she forgot to include me on said list. So, instead of working on Java in my 7th hour, I made this.

With this program, you can replace the name at the top of the page and run it immediately.

I utilize the awesome work of [this](https://github.com/Marak/faker.js) JavaScript project to get the names.

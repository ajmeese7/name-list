# name-list
Random name list generator for pissing people off.

This morning, my friend Jessica showed me a list of all the people who are important to her in her life.
Ironically, she forgot to include me on said list. So, instead of working on Java in my 7th hour, I made this.

I utilize the awesome work of [this](https://github.com/Marak/faker.js) JavaScript project to get the names.
